At present due to Covid-19, most companies, as well as schools, are working in online mode which makes it difficult to understand the level of productivity.The flourishing integration of facial recognition and facial detection in schooling and company is helping to track the productivity of students and employees via real-time emotion detection systems. Productivity can be judged by observing emotions through cameras using convolutional neural networks and detecting emotions such as happy, sad, disinterested, frustration, neutral, confusion, anger, disgust, surprise and learning. Until today models are being deployed on remote servers only. Techniques like federated learning can help in improving efficiency and effectiveness in real-world projects. This would be most applicable in sensitive fields like healthcare where data should not be compromised. In this paper, we focus on building a standalone model on a real-time emotion detection system to increase the productivity of students and employees and discuss how techniques like federated learning can be implemented in the future for building a secure model.\")"
